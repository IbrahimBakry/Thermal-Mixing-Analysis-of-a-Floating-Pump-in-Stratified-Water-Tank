# Thermal-Mixing-Analysis-of-a-Floating-Pump-in-Stratified-Water-Tank
This CFD study analyzes how a surface-floating pump affects thermal mixing in a large stratified water tank. The simulation tracks temperature homogenization and flow patterns over 3 hours, visualized through cross-sectional and bird's-eye views.
